This is an application for users to track thier selfcare routines and also view other users routines- that maybe helpful when looking for inspiration 
and self accountability.
The project uses Python/Flask for the backend and React for the front end.
The routes are private and users must log in to view , edit and delete thier routines.
They cannot delete other users routines or edit them- only the routines they added. 
I used Bcrypt for hashing passwords and JSON web token for security Authentification and Authorization
Selfcare can be very personal and intimate so the goal is to keep your information secure accurate.
